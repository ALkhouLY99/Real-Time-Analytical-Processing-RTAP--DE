**This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Real-Time Analytical Processing (RTAP) Election Analytics Platform. It covers the architecture, technologies, workflows, features, setup, and future enhancements of the project.**

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a **real-time analytics platform** that processes and visualizes data for UK candidates and voters. It integrates **Apache Spark, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Prometheus, Grafana, and Streamlit** to ensure **scalability, efficiency, and insightful data visualization**.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **📡 Data Ingestion:** `API-based streaming source`
- **🔥 Data Processing:** `Apache Spark`
- **📨 Messaging Queue:** `Apache Kafka`
- **🗄️ Database Storage:** `PostgreSQL`
- **📊 Monitoring:** `Prometheus` & `Grafana`
- **🎨 Frontend Dashboard:** `Streamlit`
- **⚙️ Automation & Management:** `Makefile`

## 🔹 System Architecture
📡 Data Flow Overview

1- Data Ingestion:

  + Real-time voting data is fetched from an API.
  + Data is sent to Kafka topics for efficient distribution.

2- Streaming Processing:

  + Apache Spark consumes data from Kafka topics.
  + Data is cleaned, transformed, and aggregated in real time.

3- Storage & Analytics:

  + Processed data is stored in PostgreSQL for historical analysis.
  + Metrics are collected by Prometheus for performance monitoring.

4- Visualization & Monitoring:

  + Streamlit Dashboard displays live analytics on voter turnout & candidate rankings.
  +  Grafana monitors system performance & Kafka queue health.

## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion:** The system fetches real-time voting data from an `external API`.
2. **Streaming Pipeline:** `Apache Kafka` queues and distributes the data efficiently.
3. **Processing Layer:** `Spark processes` and transforms the data for aggregation and analysis.
4. **Storage:** Cleaned data is stored in a `PostgreSQL` database.
5. **Monitoring:** `Prometheus` collects system metrics, and `Grafana` visualizes performance.
6. **Visualization Dashboard:** `Streamlit` presents live analytics on voter turnout, candidate rankings, and more.

## 🚀 Setup & Deployment
### 🔧 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python (>=3.8)
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Spark
- PostgreSQL
- Prometheus & Grafana

### 🛠️ Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ALkhouLY99/Real-Time-Analytical-Processing-RTAP--DE.git
cd Real-Time-Analytical-Processing-RTAP--DE
create enviroment & activate it
then run  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use the **Makefile** for easy management:
```sh
make setup      # Install dependencies
make start      # Start all services
make stop       # Stop all services
make logs       # View logs
make clean      # Remove all containers and volumes
```
